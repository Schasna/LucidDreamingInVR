# LucidDreamingInVR

This project is about creating dreams and lucid dreams in VR and allowing people to immerse themselves in them and understand the difference between lucid dreams and ordinary dreams. 
Firstly, I conducted a questionnaire survey of ordinary dreamers about the most common scenarios and feelings in people's dreams. Then I also researched in the lucid dreaming specialist forum, and through my research, with lucid dreamers, I focused on asking how lucid dreamers create their dreams in the dream world. 
In contrast to ordinary dreaming, usually, lucid dreamers do not find themselves in a dream state right from the start, but rather find themselves in a dream state as the dream progresses. 
The major difference between lucid dreamers and ordinary dreamers is that they have control over their will and actions in the dream state; lucid dreamers' dreams have cause and effect and logic, whereas ordinary dreamers' dreams do not have this feature.
